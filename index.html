        <p style="color: rgb(0, 35, 100);">I love music and listen to it all the time--last year my Spotify minutes came out to almost 50,000. Music from the 60's and 70's is the best. <strong> Here's a list of my favorite artists.</strong> </p>

<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 35, 100);"> <em> (Art, writing, and guitar)</em> </h3>

<p style="color: rgb(0, 35, 100);"> I am an art major, so of course I love art. I love drawing, painting, and sculpting, and my <em>favorite </em>thing to depict is people and faces.</p>

<p style="color: rgb(0, 35, 100);">I <em> love </em>to write stories about characters that I create. I am writing a book right now about a character who gets transported to another world and gets involved in its politics.</p>

<p style="color: rgb(0, 35, 100);"> I play guitar every day. My favorite thing to play is rock music from the 70's. I also write my own songs <em>all</em> the time. I hope m,y band becomes famous.</p>
